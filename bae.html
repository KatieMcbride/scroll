        <h1 class="moreTitle">Website Features:</h1>
        <p class="moreInfo">1. Upvote on items that want to be discussed. Downvote the items that could be in an email. Employees can engage before the meeting and let the host know what is essential to them. If an item has negative votes; it switches from an agenda item to a BAE (Be An Email) item. This item can then be sent out as an email.</p>
        <p class="moreInfo">2. Once the meeting begins,  AI-voice recognition will transcribe the conversation. So if anyone misses the meeting, they can still read what happened. AI will also analyze the transcript to review what words were used. Future innovation will analyze how on topic the meeting was.  </p>
        <p class="moreInfo">3. Under every agenda item, a task or an action item can be created during the meeting. These action items can then be assigned to anyone in attendance. If assigned,  these tasks will automatically populate in the user's profile "Task" section. Now when you leave a meeting, you know exactly what was accomplished and the next steps. </p>
        <p class="moreInfo">4. Employees can see their upcoming meeting's agenda, previous meetings with notes and transcription, and their tasks.  </p>

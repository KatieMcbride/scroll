    <h2 class="title">Taxation of Commercial Properties for School Funding</h2>
    <h3>By Katie McBride</h3>
    <br>

    <p>Quality education for our youth should be a top priority for all members of a community. While we may not see all of the far-reaching effects of a high or low performing school, it can define a community space and determine who lives in an area. While all members within the community should do their part, who should primarily fund the schools? Should it be the residential landowners that send their children to school? Should it be the commercial property owners and state to produce the funding?
 
        This debate of who is responsible for funding public schools is complex; layered with political, personal, and economic bias. But let’s break down some of the high-level pros and cons of funding public schools by taxing commercial property owners.

        “Education then, beyond all other devices of human origin, is the great equalizer of the conditions of men, the balance-wheel of the social machinery.” – Horace Mann
    </p>
    
    <h2>Pros:</h2>
    
    <p>
        While education could be the great equalizer, the access to quality books, educators, and safe schools is in no way “equal”. There is serious funding discrimination when a community relies solely on taxing residential property owners. Lower-income neighborhoods have less funding to adequately provide for their public schools, if there is no other source of funding. The inequality amongst landowners should not be passed down to our kids by giving them unequal access to quality schools. Using commercial funding could be a major push for equalizing the amount of funding that is poured into the school. This is one benefit of taxing commercial properties, equality. As schools improve, more people tend to move into that area which raises the property value and number of families that can shop/support the business. The business owner’s property value could increase when quality schools are within the boundaries.

        "Residential assessments have been so far off the mark for so many years that the credibility of the entire property tax system is in doubt."
             -The Chicago Tribune
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Property tax values can have unreliable and large swings in value based on economic factors. Our education is too important to have major swings that can change the funding for our schools. So, to balance out some of the financial impact of another housing bubble, taxing commercial properties would help. We would be able to alleviate the burden of funding our schools entirely on unstable and sometimes false property values.

                              -Gary Smith
    </p>
    
    <h2>Cons:</h2>
    
    <p>
        To promote business coming to an area, the commercial taxes should be kept as low as possible. Having high commercial property tax could have some serious, lasting consequences.  Low taxes could drive business to an area and help keep businesses afloat. 
        Our businesses could also use as much support as possible from their community. We should think of the larger picture of economic growth by lowering commercial property tax and use other sources of funding for schools.         
    </p>
    
    <p>
        It is a little bit unreasonable to assign the responsibly of school funding to commercial property when they could realistically not be the recipients of the funding. There is no consideration of usage when it comes to taxing commercial property. While I am sure that commercial property owners want to financially support their community, I do believe that we should take into consideration usage and responsibility. Commercial tax funds should be applied to resources that would assist their business.

        “State funding would dramatically reduce local control of education.”
            - The Future of U.S. Public School Revenue From The Property Tax Policy Brief
    </p>
    
    <p>
        When we switch to funding schools with commercial property, we then we lose local control of schools. Decisions will then be upon the state instead of local government and boards. Local governments are more keenly aware of what the schools need and where funding should be allocated. All schools, neighborhoods, and areas are different and are not a one-size-fits-all.  Losing local control of education would negatively affect our schools. We need our local officials to be able to fight for the schools where their children go. 
    </p>
    
    <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
    
    <p>
        While weighing both the pros and cons of taxing commercial property owners to fund our schools, I think that we should continue taxing commercial property as a source for funding. I believe that the moral pros outweigh the cons. Our businesses should be fiscally responsible to create equality for all schools. I believe that equality in school funding is a superior motivation than usage and power.  I do believe that there should be balance and residential property taxes should also contribute financially. In an ideal world, there would be a perfect balance as well as equal opportunity to quality schools. While we strive for that balance and equality, we should continue to tax commercial properties.
